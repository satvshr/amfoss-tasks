## My introduction
Hey! I am Satvik Mishra in S1 CSE-AI< i Have been living in Kolkata for the last 8 years, I was born in Indore, Madhya Pradesh(my mom's hometown) and my dad is from Orissa, so whenever someone asks me where I am from it turns into a small 50 word essay. I also have ADHD and terrible anxiety which I have observed when I am solving very complex problems but comes to bite me back when I have to do the most simple problems as I tend to end up overthinking the problem and oding it in the most complex way humanly possible.
