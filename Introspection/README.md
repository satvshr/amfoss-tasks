# Introspection
## Why must we choose you?
The main reason you should choose me is because I need this club and its mentors' experience way more than anyone can imagine.  
I spent my last 2 years (classes 11 and 12) doing absolutely nothing and now that I've realised what a blunder I had made I want to give it my absolute best in college,which was one of the main reasons I joined this campus as I already had read about this club on Quora(I had already taken a small 2 hour course on GitHub before joining college as I had read on quora that it'll be useful in order to do the tasks). I promise to bring all my dedication and hardwork into whatever I do as a part of the club and give it  all my blood, sweat and tears.

## What is your plan for the next 6 months?
In the next 6 months I plan to settle into this environment with a fixed and healthy schedule (which includes exercising, something I haven't started doing over here). If I do end up becoming a part of this club I would definitely want to deep dive into the world of flutter and app development, something I could also do on my own in case I get rejected but obviously being a part of this clubs app development team and being guided my mentors like Rishab bhaiya, Aman bhaiya and Akshat Bhaiya would give me a tremendous boost in terms of resources.

## How would you contribute back to the club?
I would contribute back to the club by hopefully creating projects which will exceed the base standards set by the club and something the club would be proud to associate itself with. I also would love to become a mentor as I have a low self confidence and guiding someone to become as good as me and actually see them achieve stuff would give me a huge confidence boost while also helping carry forward the legacy of the club, basically hitting 2 birds with 1 stone!

## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
The tasks provide a good overview to us first years on the different languages which exist and how can we implement each of them to create something meaningful, while also indirectly helping us decide which field we'd like to pursue by giving us an on hand experience.
What would be interesting to see is how the club is going to diffrenciate between people who actually put effort into doing the tasks as compared to someone who just copied it from someone or 2 people who sat down and did the tasks together.
