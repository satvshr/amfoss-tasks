# How I found the password
Used git clone https://github.com/gauthamk02/TerminalHunt.git to clone the repository into VS code. \
Created solution directory using VS code. 
## Part 1:
For part 1 of the solution I multiplied 6 with 44,got 264 whic his the atomic mass of bohrium,whose atomic number
is 107.
## Part 2:
The HCF of 336 and 702 is 6,the fourth digit of pi is 1,so from the 6th folder 1st file I got the code for 
part 2.
## Part 3:
Next I opened GitHub and checked the previous commits made,where I was told to go to the file which wsa the 
lowest 3 digit prime number(101) so  Iwent to the 10th folder,1st file and got the code for part 3.
***
Next I commited all these changes by:
git add .
git commit -m"commiting 3 parts of solution"
***
## Part 4:
I used:
git branch a 
and then switched to the branch: remotes/origin/asia
using: git checkout remotes/origin/asia
then used: find . name athens.txt to find the 4th and final part.
then I switched ot the main branch using: git checkout main
merged the branch remotes/origin/asia to main using: git merge remotes/origin/asia
and shifted the athens.txt to my solution folder and renamed it part 4.
***
Next I put all the 4 parts together under password.txt and unlocked the pdf using the password...
Successful!!!
